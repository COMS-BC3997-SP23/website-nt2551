description: This week I struggle with the Design because it looks too much and I could not see where was the main components and what I should do in the page. I got feedback by one of my friends who works in product design/management and he gave me some advice on how to improve my design. He told me that I should turn all the colors to grey scale and make the more important components darker. So this week I did that and will be redoing my color next week.
