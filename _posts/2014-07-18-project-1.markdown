description: I proposed the development of an innovative app that leverages augmented reality technology to provide a more accurate and convenient way of designing and selecting nail designs. This app will allow users to preview different designs on their own hands in real-time through the use of their phone camera. The most important goal of this project is to use AR and preview the pre-made nail designs The secondary goal of this project is to allow user design nails directly on the app and then view the nails they designed through the AR function
