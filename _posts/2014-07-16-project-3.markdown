description: This week is the week where I start developing the app's user interface, ensuring it is user-friendly and intuitive. I looked at the inspirations for my app UI on Dribbble. I put everything together (all of the designs that I like) into a Figma prototype and start to design my 3 main frames, which is the structure of my app (Design, AR camera, Profile). I also chose a color scheme and might not stick with it.
