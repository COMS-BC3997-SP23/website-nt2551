description: I explored a few technology to build this and some options came up. For app development I will be using React Native since I’ve tried it before and it worked well for me so it’s a solid option for this project. For AR options, I looked at SparkAR and SnapAR. SparkAR didn't support hand gesture before, but they might now, so it might not be very good. For SnapAR, I tried a hand filter and it's pretty good. The accuracy is not to what I expected, so I might want to see if I can improve this.
