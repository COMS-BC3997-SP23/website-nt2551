description: This week I redesigned the pages so that it would look cleaner and clearer for user. I added a lot more details and even drew the nails designs on Procreate as a sample for this design. I'm a lot more satisfied with this design and will start to code it next week. It did take a long time to find the fonts and colors that fit to what I visioned.
