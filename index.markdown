The project I'm doing for COMS BC3997 involves using machine learning on single cell dataset to provide insight for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The dataset is a count matrix that contains the gene mapping of each of the individuals sampled for the dataset. By first cleaning up the dataset to isolate genes of interest and then using various machine learning techniques, I hope to find commonalities between the expressed genes and a patient's diagnosis. Updates to the website will be made weekly, and can be seen through the pages on the right hand side.
